# Linear Search(Sequential Search)
## Concept
### 1. Start ad begining
### 2. Move sequentially
### 3. Compare the current value to the target
### 4. Reach end of of the list
### We can explain these methods by a simple example: In order to find the target(76) in nums = [1,2,3,...,100]. In this example, if you use Linear Search, it means that you count the nums from 1 to 100(1 by 1) to find the target.
